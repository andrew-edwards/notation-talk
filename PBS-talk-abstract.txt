Some guidance on using mathematical notation in biology

Mathematical modelling is playing an increasing role in studies of biological
systems. This requires communicating the details of models, including the use
of mathematical notation to represent biological variables, parameters and
processes. The clarity of mathematical notation varies between papers and can
often be inconsistent with general conventions. Poor notation can impede
communication and understanding of ideas, and make models appear more
complicated than necessary. I will present some guidelines and examples, all based on
our recent paper in Methods in Ecology and Evolution (https://t.co/baRCR1Q2hT).
