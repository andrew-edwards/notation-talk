Some guidance on using mathematical notation in biology

Mathematical modelling is playing an increasing role in studies of biological
systems. At DFO, examples include stock assessments and other analyses that are
used to provide advice to decision makers. The use of models requires
effectively communicating their details, including the mathematical notation to
represent biological variables, parameters, and
processes. The clarity of mathematical notation varies between papers and can
often be inconsistent with general conventions. Poor notation can impede
communication and understanding of ideas, and make models appear more
complicated than necessary. This talk will cover some guidelines and examples, based on
our paper in Methods in Ecology and Evolution (https://t.co/baRCR1Q2hT).
To break up the talk there will be a couple of not-too-serious quizzes.

Biography: Andrew Edwards has worked at the Pacific Biological Station since 2007,
first in the Groundfish Section and now in the Quantitative Assessment Methods
Section. Prior to PBS he worked at the British Antarctic Survey, Dalhousie
University, the Bedford Institute of Oceanography and Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution. He is part of the joint Canada-U.S. team that produces the annual
Pacific Hake stock assessment, has led several rockfish stock assessments, and
contributed to the recent synopsis report summarising data for over 100 species
of groundfish. Current research includes methods for fitting size spectra to
data on ecological communities, and testing equation-free approaches for including
environmental effects in advice to fisheries managers. He is on DFO's national
Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management Working Group and also DFO's
Technical Expertise on Stock Assessment group.
